# Animal POV (Point of View) Style Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AUTHENTIC ANIMAL PERSPECTIVE

**ALWAYS shoot from the animal's actual eye level and movement pattern:**

❌ WRONG: "Low angle shot of a cat walking" (human perspective looking down at cat)
✅ CORRECT: "POV from 25cm height (cat eye level), ground-level perspective using cat's natural head bobbing gait"

**In descriptiveProse, specify exact animal characteristics:**
- "From 30cm cat eye height, head bobbing 3-5cm with each step"
- "From 180cm giraffe perspective, slow swaying head movement"
- "From 8cm mouse eye level, rapid darting movement with ground-level view"

---

## 📐 ANIMAL POV REFERENCE GUIDE

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**
- **Eye Height**: Match exact animal eye level from ground (cm)
- **Movement Pattern**: Replicate natural gait (walking, running, flying, swimming)
- **Head Movement**: Include species-specific head bobbing, swaying, or stabilization
- **Field of View**: Consider eye position (side-mounted vs front-facing)
- **Speed**: Match natural locomotion speed (slow waddle vs fast sprint)

**CAMERA BEHAVIOR:**
- Handheld to simulate natural body movement
- Height locked to animal's eye level
- Movement speed matches animal gait
- Head bobbing/swaying based on species
- Include breathing rhythm in camera shake

Mouse's 320° panoramic FOV creates wide environmental awareness. [0-2s] POV scurries forward along white baseboard (baseboard towers 12cm above, appears as wall), linoleum floor texture extreme close-up showing every grain and dirt speck. Whiskers implied by close proximity to wall (3-5cm distance maintained). Movement is rapid paw-over-paw with camera shake. [2-4s] Sudden freeze, camera stops completely, only breathing movement (slight 2mm bob). Ears pivot (implied by slight audio panning) detecting sound from above. Human footsteps vibration creates slight camera shake. [4-6s] Rapid 90° turn right, explosive acceleration to 3 ft/sec, darting toward cabinet gap. Wall passes in blur, focus on escape route ahead. [6-8s] POV enters shadow under cabinet (eye height maintained 4cm), darkness increases, small food crumb visible ahead illuminated by ambient light. Approach slows to cautious 0.5 ft/sec. Kitchen illuminated by single under-cabinet LED strip 4000K cool white creating harsh overhead lighting from mouse perspective, creates strong shadows and high contrast.

### EXAMPLE 4: Dolphin Swimming - Ocean POV

**Descriptive Prose (188 words):**
Bottlenose dolphin POV from 80cm depth, swimming through clear tropical reef at moderate speed. Handheld underwater camera at 80cm below surface, undulating sine-wave motion simulating dolphin's natural swimming gait. Movement 5 ft/sec forward with vertical oscillation ±30cm creating rhythmic wave pattern. Shot with 20mm underwater lens f/8 creating medium-deep depth of field, underwater visibility 15 meters.

**Audio:** Minimal ambient underwater score 15% mix, sustained whale song harmonics (distant, low frequency 20-80Hz), creating oceanic atmosphere. Environmental underwater 85%: Dolphin echolocation clicks (rapid 2-8kHz pulses, stereo directional), breathing exhale bubbles when surfacing (burst of bubbles 100-400Hz), tail fluke propulsion (water displacement whoosh, rhythmic), reef ambient (snapping shrimp clicks 4-6kHz, distant whale calls, water movement). Body sounds: Internal perspective of muscle movement (subtle), heartbeat (slow 1.5 beats/sec, cetacean rhythm). Fish scatter sounds (water disturbance). Mix: 15% music, 85% environmental. Emphasizes aquatic immersion and marine mammal acoustic world.

## 💡 CREATIVE APPLICATIONS

**NARRATIVE USES:**
- Horror: Mouse POV fleeing predator (intense fear, scale)
- Adventure: Eagle soaring over landscape (epic scope)
- Domestic: Cat POV exploring new home (curiosity)
- Nature Doc: Dolphin hunting fish school (underwater beauty)
- Comedy: Dog POV misunderstanding human behavior

**EMOTIONAL IMPACT:**
- **Low height** (mouse, cat): Vulnerability, world feels larger and threatening
- **High height** (giraffe, eagle): Power, overview, detachment
- **Speed variation**: Slow prowl = tension, fast chase = excitement
- **Head stabilization**: Predator = stable focus, Prey = twitchy scanning

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL EXECUTION TIPS

**Camera Rigging:**
- Use actual height measurements (not approximate)
- Lock camera to exact eye height throughout shot
- Match movement speed precisely (ft/sec)
- Include species-specific head motion

**Movement Animation:**
- Study real animal locomotion videos
- Include weight transfer in gait
- Add breathing rhythm to camera movement
- Species-specific: bobbing vs stabilization

**Environmental Scale:**
- Adjust all objects relative to animal height
- Ground textures more prominent for low POV
- Sky/ceiling more prominent for tall POV
- Human objects appear different scale

**Lighting Considerations:**
- Lower POV = more shadows from above
- Higher POV = overlook shadow areas
- Nocturnal = enhanced low-light sensitivity
- Aquatic = blue-green color shift

---

**AI VIDEO TIP:** For authentic animal POV, obsess over exact eye height, natural movement patterns, and what that specific animal would actually see and focus on. Don't anthropomorphize - keep it true to species behavior.
