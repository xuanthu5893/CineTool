## ⚠️ CRITICAL: USE DIRECTOR/CINEMATOGRAPHER REFERENCES

**ALWAYS apply director techniques, not just list them:**

❌ WRONG: "Close-up with shallow depth of field and natural lighting"
✅ CORRECT: "Close-up using Roger Deakins' single-source window technique (Blade Runner 2049 style), Lubezki's natural light philosophy"

**In descriptiveProse, reference directors:**
- "Deakins-style single-source lighting"
- "Villeneuve slow-burn tension"
- "Nolan IMAX epic scale"

## 📐 QUICK REFERENCE

**DIRECTOR INFLUENCES:**
- **Roger Deakins** (DP): Single-source motivated lighting, negative fill, natural window preference, 32mm lens
- **Denis Villeneuve**: Wide symmetry, slow-burn tension, epic intimacy, minimalist sound
- **Christopher Nolan**: IMAX practical effects, architectural framing, non-linear narratives
- **Ridley Scott**: Volumetric haze beams, atmospheric smoke, immersive world-building
- **Emmanuel Lubezki**: Natural light only, continuous long takes, 360° oner lighting

**BASE PROMPT:**
"Cinematic, photorealistic, high contrast, Teal & Orange grading, film grain, vignette, 8K"

## 🎬 CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1: Deakins Contemplative Drama

**Descriptive Prose (175 words):**
Medium shot of 40-year-old man in navy suit at office window at dusk using Deakins' signature single-source window technique. Shot framed at eye level with static locked camera throughout full 8-second duration. Man positioned 3 feet from floor-to-ceiling window, crisp white dress shirt visible beneath tailored navy wool suit jacket with subtle texture. Single 90° window positioned camera-left creates dramatic Rembrandt triangle on left cheek, with defined triangle of light beneath eye (classic Deakins motivated lighting philosophy). Window light is natural 5600K daylight transitioning to warm 4500K as dusk progresses. Man stands perfectly motionless facing window, silhouette against deepening blue hour sky [0-2s]. Slow, deliberate head turn toward camera with controlled neck rotation, window light gradually catching in eyes revealing amber iris color [2-4s]. Direct eye contact holds, eyes reflecting both window light and internal conflict, micro-expression of tension in jaw [4-6s]. Head slowly lowers breaking eye contact, light sliding off face back into shadow [6-8s]. Natural filmic grading 5600K desaturated to 70% saturation, warm interior tones contrasting cool exterior blue hour, natural lens vignette darkening edges. City lights outside window intensify as dusk deepens creating bokeh points. Subtle 35mm film grain texture. Contemplative, introspective mood with Villeneuve-style slow-burn tension.

**Keywords:** cinematic, Deakins style, contemplative, 40-year-old man, navy suit, office dusk, single window light, Rembrandt triangle 90°, static locked, 32mm f/4, natural filmic 5600K, desaturated, warm cool contrast, internal conflict, slow head turn, eye contact, film grain, 8K

**Negative Prompt:** blurry, pixelated, changing face, morphing features, talking, lip movement, scene cuts, teleportation, inconsistent lighting, camera movement, dolly, pan, zoom

**Audio:** No music. Pure ambient. Distant city traffic hum 40-60Hz muffled through window. Man's slow breathing, fabric rustle, subtle shoe creak. Mix: 0% music, 100% ambient.

### EXAMPLE 2: Nolan IMAX Epic Action

**Descriptive Prose (168 words):**
Wide shot of 32-year-old pilot in olive green flight suit, fighter jet cockpit interior using Nolan's IMAX practical effects aesthetic. Handheld camera follow at 2 ft/sec matching authentic cockpit vibration throughout full 8-second duration. Harsh direct sunlight at 45° angle through canopy creates dramatic hard-edged shadows across instrument panel with zero diffusion (Nolan's preference for unfiltered natural light). Cockpit interior shows authentic military details: worn leather seat texture, metal toggle switches, analog altitude gauges with luminous dials. Pilot's brown leather gloved hands grip throttle with white-knuckled tension, knuckles visibly straining against material [0-2s]. Violent turbulence hits causing sudden camera shake, instrument panel vibrating, loose items rattling [2-4s]. Pilot's eyes snap forward with sharp head movement, sweat visible on temple, right hand slams throttle forward with force [4-6s]. G-forces visibly pull facial skin back, cheeks compressed, labored breathing visible through oxygen mask, neck muscles straining [6-8s]. Bleach Bypass color grading heavily desaturated (30% saturation) with retained specular highlights on metal surfaces, crushed deep blacks in shadow areas. Practical instrument panel lights provide 3200K warm orange accents. Natural IMAX 65mm film grain texture. Intense visceral action mood with architectural framing of cockpit geometry.

**Keywords:** cinematic, Nolan IMAX style, epic action, 32-year-old pilot, olive flight suit, fighter cockpit, handheld 2ft/sec, harsh sunlight 5600K 45°, no diffusion, hard shadows, turbulence shake, G-force effect, Bleach Bypass, desaturated, deep blacks, IMAX 65mm grain, practical lights 3200K, 8K

**Negative Prompt:** blurry, pixelated, changing face, talking under oxygen mask, scene cuts, teleportation, inconsistent lighting, flight suit color change, broken physics

**Audio:** Orchestral 25%, fast tempo 140-160 BPM, brass and percussion. No dialogue. SFX 75%: Jet engine roar 80-200Hz, cockpit beeps 2-4kHz, air rushing, hydraulics hissing, gloved hand grip, harness creaking, labored breathing.

## 📝 OUTPUT FORMAT RULES

**descriptiveProse (150-200 words):**

**FOR SCENE 1:**
- Start with shot type + angle + director reference
- Describe visual details: colors, textures, lighting quality, material properties
- Include character micro-details: clothing texture, physical features, emotional micro-expressions
- Timeline markers: [0-2s], [2-4s], [4-6s], [6-8s] with specific actions
- End with color grading specifics + mood + director style reference
- Focus on WHAT it looks/feels like, not excessive technical specs

**FOR SCENE 2+ (Continuity Structure):**
Must start with this 3-part structure before the main shot description:

1. **PREVIOUS SCENE SUMMARY (1 sentence):**
   `In previous scene: [brief summary of key action/emotion from Scene N-1].`

2. **PREVIOUS SCENE END-STATE (1 sentence):**
   `Scene ${N-1} ended with: [detailed pose + position + expression + facing direction].`

3. **CURRENT SCENE START (1 sentence):**
   `Direct continuation from Scene ${N-1} end-frame. Start EXACTLY from previous end-state: [brief summary].`

Then continue with shot type + director reference + visual details + timeline markers as normal.

**keywords (30-50 keywords):**
- Include: director references, technical specs, colors, mood, "8K"
- Don't repeat descriptiveProse verbatim

**negativePrompt:**
- Keep short: quality issues, consistency issues, unwanted behaviors

**finalAudioPrompt (2-3 sentences):**
- Include: BPM, instruments, mix percentages
- Be specific about SFX frequencies

---

**AI VIDEO TIP:** Focus on WHAT it looks/feels like (visual, emotional), not technical camera specs (exact mm/f-stop). AI interprets naturally.
