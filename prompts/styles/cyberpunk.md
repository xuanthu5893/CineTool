# Cyberpunk Style Prompts

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: HOW TO USE DIRECTOR/CINEMATOGRAPHER REFERENCES

**When generating scene prompts, you MUST actively apply director/cinematographer techniques, not just list them.**

For every technical choice (shot size, angle, movement, lighting, color), ask yourself:
- "Which director/cinematographer is known for this technique?"
- "What specific film moment exemplifies this choice?"
- "How can I describe this using their cyberpunk language?"

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
❌ WRONG: "Wide shot with neon lighting and atmospheric smoke"
✅ CORRECT: "Wide shot using Ridley Scott's Blade Runner layered depth technique (rain-soaked street aesthetic), with Jordan Cronenweth's smoke-haze backlighting and neon practical sources"

**In your descriptiveProse, incorporate director references like this:**
- "In the style of [Director's] [specific film moment]"
- "Using [Cinematographer's] [technique name]"
- "Following [Director's] approach to [scene type]"

This creates a shared cyberpunk vocabulary that AI understands through training data on these films.

Thousands of building lights visible creating overwhelming scale. [2.0s-4.0s] Crane continues smooth descent, agent becomes slightly larger in frame but still small against megacity. Wrist interface projects small holographic display (orange geometric HUD), agent glances down at data. Flying car passes 50 feet below with white light trail.
