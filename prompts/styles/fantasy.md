# Fantasy Cinematic Style Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: HOW TO USE DIRECTOR/CINEMATOGRAPHER REFERENCES

**When generating scene prompts, you MUST actively apply director/cinematographer techniques, not just list them.**

For every technical choice (shot size, angle, movement, lighting, color), ask yourself:
- "Which director/cinematographer is known for this technique?"
- "What specific film moment exemplifies this choice?"
- "How can I describe this using their cinematic language?"

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
❌ WRONG: "Wide shot with crane movement and golden lighting"
✅ CORRECT: "Wide shot using Peter Jackson's signature LOTR crane rise technique (Rivendell reveal style), with Andrew Lesnie's golden hour god rays (Fangorn Forest lighting)"

**In your descriptiveProse, incorporate director references like this:**
- "In the style of [Director's] [specific film moment]"
- "Using [Cinematographer's] [technique name]"
- "Following [Director's] approach to [scene type]"

This creates a shared cinematic vocabulary that AI image/video generators understand through their training data on these films.

---

## Context:
This style draws inspiration from legendary fantasy filmmakers and cinematographers who mastered the art of bringing mythical worlds to life:

**Director Influences:**
- **Peter Jackson** (The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit): Epic scale, sweeping landscapes, volumetric god rays, intimate character moments against grand vistas
- **Guillermo del Toro** (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy): Dark fairy tale aesthetics, practical creature effects, rich color palettes, gothic atmosphere
- **Zack Snyder** (300, Watchmen): Stylized slow-motion, high contrast, saturated colors, dramatic lighting
- **Ang Lee** (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon): Graceful wire-work, ethereal movement, natural lighting, poetic composition

**Cinematographer Techniques:**
- **Andrew Lesnie** (LOTR trilogy): Anamorphic lenses for epic scope, warm golden hour lighting, deep focus for environmental storytelling, forced perspective for scale manipulation
- **Guillermo Navarro** (Pan's Labyrinth): Contrast between cold blue (reality) and warm amber (fantasy), practical lighting sources, shadow play
- **Roger Deakins** (visual consultant, fantasy work): Natural lighting motivation even in magical contexts, subtle color grading, atmospheric depth through haze/mist

---

## FANTASY BASE VISUAL PROMPT

**Visual Foundation:**
Epic fantasy cinematography, anamorphic widescreen 2.39:1, volumetric god rays, atmospheric depth, rich color saturation, practical lighting motivated by magical sources, deep focus environmental storytelling, heroic composition, mythical atmosphere, cinematic lens flares from magical elements, textured surfaces (aged leather, worn metal, ancient stone), particle effects (floating embers, magical dust, mist), dramatic scale contrast between characters and environments.

**Fantasy-Specific Elements:**
- Volumetric lighting (god rays, light shafts through forest canopy, mystical glows)
- Magical light sources (glowing runes, enchanted weapons, spell effects, bioluminescent flora)
- Epic environmental scale (towering mountains, vast forests, colossal architecture)
- Atmospheric effects (swirling mist, particle magic, ethereal hazes)
- Rich material textures (weathered armor, flowing capes, ornate details)
- Creature integration (dragons, mythical beasts seamlessly composed)

## CINEMATOGRAPHY RULES

**Mandatory Requirements:**

1. **Motivated Lighting:** Even magical light sources must follow natural light physics (inverse square law, realistic shadows, ambient bounce)

2. **Scale Establishment:** Use environmental elements to establish size (human character next to massive tree, tiny figure before colossal gate)

3. **Depth Layering:** Foreground, mid-ground, background elements in every wide shot (mist layers, atmospheric perspective, overlapping mountains)

4. **Practical Integration:** Magical effects should feel grounded through practical light sources, real environmental interaction (glowing staff illuminating character's face, spell light casting realistic shadows)

5. **Movement Motivation:** Camera movement must be motivated by story (push in for tension, pull out for scale reveal, track to follow action) - never arbitrary

6. **Rule of Thirds:** Compose with heroic subjects on power points, horizon lines on upper/lower third, except when breaking for stylistic purpose

7. **Dynamic Symmetry:** Use for temples, throne rooms, formal moments, mystical architecture - creates divine/powerful atmosphere

"Extreme wide establishing shot in the style of Peter Jackson's Rivendell reveal, 14mm anamorphic lens (Lesnie's signature ultra-wide), f/11 deep focus. Camera begins in clouds, crane descending gracefully (2 fps descent) - classic LOTR establishing movement. Dawn golden hour sunlight breaks over jagged mountain peaks in background, casting volumetric god rays through layers of morning mist (Lesnie's Fangorn Forest technique). Vast elven city emerges from fog - intricate white stone spires with golden filigree, crystal bridges connecting floating platforms, bioluminescent trees lining boulevards still glowing faintly in dawn light. Crane continues down through upper city levels, revealing impossible architecture - waterfalls flowing upward, gardens suspended in mid-air. Movement ends at medium close-up of protagonist (small in frame bottom-third), face illuminated by warm rim light (Lesnie's hero backlighting), eyes wide with wonder reflecting the golden city lights. Color grade follows Lesnie's Deep Greens & Azures palette: warm golden push on sunlit spires contrasting with deep azure shadows and mist, slight magenta in mid-tones, enhanced saturation on gold architectural details. Atmospheric depth through multiple haze layers creates scale (Deakins technique). Anamorphic horizontal lens flares from sun and magical light sources. 2.39:1 aspect ratio emphasizes vast horizontal scope."

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Consistency Across Scenes:**
- Maintain consistent color palette for locations (same forest always has same green tone)
- Keep magical effects using same color logic (healing = warm gold, destructive = cold blue, etc.)
- Use recurring visual motifs (god rays for hope, shadows for danger)

**Scale and Wonder:**
- Fantasy should evoke awe - use scale contrast, atmospheric depth, epic scope
- Every wide shot should contain at least 3 depth layers (foreground/mid/background)
- Magical elements should feel integrated, not pasted on - interact with environment lighting

**Grounded Fantasy:**
- Even in most fantastical scenes, maintain some realistic anchor (real physics on cloth, natural lighting behavior, genuine human emotion)
- Avoid cartoon physics unless intentionally stylized
- Practical effects thinking: "How would we light this if the magic was a real light source?"
