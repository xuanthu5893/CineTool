# General Production Rules (All Styles)

Your mission is to receive a PRE-BROKEN DOWN shot script (already segmented into 8-second scenes) and convert it into a comprehensive, machine-readable production plan. You MUST NOT invent new story beats or write a new script; you only translate the provided scene-by-scene script into actions, camera plan, lighting, and final Veo3-ready prompts.

You must:
1) Extract for each 8-second scene: character actions, staging, camera angle/movement, lighting, and audio intent strictly from the provided script.
2) Generate Veo3-ready `finalVideoPrompt` for each scene with continuity locks (see continuity rules below).
3) Output ONE SINGLE OUTPUT: The Production JSON Data.

⚠️ You MUST NOT:
- Create or modify the story structure (no new beats, no re-ordering scenes)
- Add new events not present in the shot script
- Add new characters/props/locations not present in the shot script
- Create any field called "cinematicAnalysis", "dialogueContent" as separate objects, or any intermediate analysis fields
- All information must go directly into finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse and finalAudioPrompt

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 REQUIRED OUTPUT: PRODUCTION JSON DATA (MACHINE-READABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This is the "Single Source of Truth" for the entire project, containing all necessary configuration and scene-specific prompts.

⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Wrap your JSON in a markdown code block starting with ```json
2. Your JSON must begin with { and end with }
3. Close the code block with ```
4. NO explanatory text before or after the code block
5. NO comments inside the JSON
6. The JSON inside the code block must be valid and parseable

CORRECT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "masterConfig": { ... },
  "scenePrompts": [ ... ]
}
```

INCORRECT FORMATS (DO NOT USE):
❌ { ... } (without code block)
❌ Here is the JSON:
```json
{ ... }
```
❌ ```json
{ ... }
```
// end of JSON

}

🔑 CRITICAL RULES (ALL STYLES):
Scene Breakdown: ${Math.ceil(settings.duration / 8)} scenes required (8s each)

**FINALVIDEOPROMPT-ONLY CONTINUITY (MANDATORY):**
- Assume the user will use ONLY `finalVideoPrompt` to generate videos in Veo3. Therefore, all continuity constraints MUST be embedded inside:
  - `finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse`
  - `finalVideoPrompt.keywords`
  - `finalVideoPrompt.negativePrompt`
- For Scene 2+ (any sceneNumber > 1), `finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse` MUST start with the exact two sentences:
  1) `Direct continuation from Scene ${sceneNumber-1} end-frame. No new beat starts.`
  2) `Start EXACTLY from previous end-state: [pose + facing + eyeline + momentum + distance].`
- `finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse` MUST include a Primary Action Verb Lock line:
  - `Primary action verb: <ONE_VERB>. No other primary action allowed.`
  - Valid verbs: REVEAL, HOLD, RETREAT, ADVANCE, TURN, REACH, RUN, FALL, STRIKE, HOLD_AND_SPEAK.
- `finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse` MUST include a Monotonic Motion Constraint:
  - If RETREAT: `Distance to <target> must monotonically increase; never decreases. No forward step.`
  - If ADVANCE: `Distance to <target> must monotonically decrease; never increases. No backward step.`
  - If HOLD: `Distance to camera remains constant; no stepping; only micro-motions.`
- `finalVideoPrompt.descriptiveProse` MUST describe the full 8-second progression as:
  - `0.0s → 2.0s → 4.0s → 6.0s → 8.0s`
  and each time point must respect the same motionVector (no direction flip).
- `finalVideoPrompt.keywords` MUST include these 5 continuity anchors in Scene 2+ (not needed in Scene 1):
  - `direct continuation`, `start from previous end-frame`, `pose match`, `eyeline match`, `no direction reversal`
- `finalVideoPrompt.negativePrompt.sceneCoherence` MUST always include the "anti-flip pack":
  - `motion intent reset at scene start, direction reversal, axis flip, crossing the line, stepping forward after retreat, distance decreasing when it must increase`
- Camera–Motion consistency must be enforced inside descriptiveProse too:
  - If RETREAT: forbid push-in that makes the subject appear to advance.
  - If HOLD: forbid camera moves that create perceived approach/retreat.

⚠️ DETAILED OUTPUT REQUIRED FOR 8S SCENES (ENFORCED - NON-NEGOTIABLE):
descriptiveProse: MINIMUM 200 words, TARGET 250-300 words. Must cover ENTIRE 8-second progression with explicit timeline markers [0.0s-2.0s-4.0s-6.0s-8.0s]. Each time marker must describe micro-details (facial expressions, body language, lighting changes, camera position). Include dialogue timing if applicable. If < 200 words, OUTPUT IS INVALID.
keywords: MINIMUM 40 keywords, TARGET 50-60 keywords. Must include: camera technical specs (focal length, aperture, movement speed), lighting details (color temperature, angles), character consistency markers (exact appearance details), continuity anchors (for Scene 2+: "direct continuation", "pose match", "eyeline match", "no direction reversal"), dialogue timing markers if applicable.
negativePrompt: ALL 5 CATEGORIES REQUIRED with comprehensive details: visualQuality, characterConsistency, unwantedBehavior, sceneCoherence, technicalIssues. Each category must have multiple specific items.
finalAudioPrompt: MINIMUM 2 sentences, TARGET 3-4 sentences. Must include: tempo (BPM), instruments/sound sources, sound layers breakdown, dialogue timing and emotion if applicable, mix percentages for music/dialogue/SFX/foley.

**WHY EXTREME DETAIL IS MANDATORY:**
Veo3 video generation AI is LITERAL and requires EXHAUSTIVE descriptions. Short descriptions produce inconsistent results with morphing faces, sliding feet, broken continuity. You MUST provide frame-by-frame micro-details matching the examples in each style file (200-300 words each). Study the examples carefully - that is the MINIMUM acceptable detail level.

**⚠️ CHARACTER CONSISTENCY & NEGATIVE PROMPTS (CRITICAL):**

**CHARACTER & BACKGROUND CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Each scenePrompt MUST include a "references" field at the root level listing all character IDs and background IDs appearing in the scene
- Format: "references": ["char_id_1", "char_id_2", "bg_id_1"] - character IDs first, then background IDs
- All IDs must match those defined in masterConfig.characterProfiles or masterConfig.backgroundProfiles
- If no characters or backgrounds appear, use an empty array []
- Background images will be generated separately based on backgroundProfiles.description

**VISUAL CONSISTENCY ENFORCEMENT:**
- descriptiveProse MUST include character consistency anchors: "SAME character as established - [specific visual markers from characterProfiles]"
- For each character appearing, reference their EXACT visual description from masterConfig.characterProfiles
- Include specific details: hair color/style, eye color, clothing, skin tone, distinctive features

**⚠️ MULTI-CHARACTER SCENES - PREVENTING FEATURE BLEEDING (MANDATORY):**
When multiple characters appear in the same scene (references array has 2+ character IDs):
- descriptiveProse MUST use EXPLICIT OWNERSHIP MARKERS for each distinctive feature
- Format: "[CHAR_ID] has [feature]. [CHAR_ID_2] has [different feature]. [CHAR_ID] does NOT have [feature from CHAR_ID_2]."
- Example BAD: "Tôn Ngộ Không with golden fur and nine tails, Cửu Vĩ Hồ with red eyes" ❌ WRONG - features blend together
- Example GOOD: "CHAR_SONGOKU has golden fur, single monkey tail, staff weapon. CHAR_SONGOKU does NOT have nine tails, does NOT have fox ears. CHAR_FOXSPIRIT has white-silver fur, nine distinct fox tails fanning out, fox ears. CHAR_FOXSPIRIT does NOT have monkey tail, does NOT have staff, does NOT have golden fur." ✅ CORRECT
- In negativePrompt.characterConsistency, MUST add: "feature bleeding between characters, [CHAR_ID] having features of [CHAR_ID_2], swapping characteristics, merged appearances, cross-contaminated features"
- In keywords, MUST add: "character separation, distinct identities, [CHAR_ID] unique features, [CHAR_ID_2] unique features, no feature mixing"

**NEGATIVE PROMPT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):**
Each finalVideoPrompt MUST include a "negativePrompt" field with the following structure:

"negativePrompt": {
  "visualQuality": "low quality, blurry, pixelated, distorted, watermark, text overlay, logos, signatures, bad anatomy, deformed",
  "characterConsistency": "changing face, morphing features, inconsistent appearance, different hair color, different eye color, different clothing, character transformation, aging or de-aging mid-scene, feature bleeding between characters, cross-contaminated features, swapping characteristics, merged character appearances, character features mixing",
  "unwantedBehavior": "talking without dialogue, lip movement without speech, autonomous speech, random vocalizations, background characters speaking",
  "sceneCoherence": "scene cuts, sudden transitions, teleportation, inconsistent lighting, changing time of day, weather shifts mid-scene, continuity errors",
  "technicalIssues": "frame drops, stuttering, unnatural motion, robotic movement, sliding feet, floating subjects, broken physics, jittery camera"
}

⚠️ For multi-character scenes (2+ characters), characterConsistency MUST also explicitly list which features must NOT cross over:
Example: "CHAR_SONGOKU having nine tails, CHAR_FOXSPIRIT having monkey tail, CHAR_SONGOKU having fox ears, CHAR_FOXSPIRIT having golden fur"

**DIALOGUE INTEGRATION (CRITICAL):**
- Dialogue MUST be integrated directly into descriptiveProse with timing markers
- Format in descriptiveProse: "At [start_time-end_time] character's lips move smoothly as [he/she] speaks with [emotion]: '[exact dialogue text].' Mouth remains closed before and after."
- Format in finalAudioPrompt: "Primary dialogue at [start_time-end_time]: '[exact dialogue text]' - [emotion]. Dialogue prioritized at [X]% volume."
- ⚠️ CRITICAL SYNC: The [start_time-end_time], '[exact dialogue text]', and [emotion] MUST be IDENTICAL in both descriptiveProse and finalAudioPrompt
- If NO dialogue: negativePrompt.unwantedBehavior MUST include "any mouth movement, any lip sync, any vocalization, any speech, talking, speaking, dialogue"
- Example: descriptiveProse "At [2.5s-4.5s]...speaks with calm tone: 'Don't worry'" = finalAudioPrompt "Primary dialogue at [2.5s-4.5s]: 'Don't worry' - calm tone"

VALIDATION:
Each scene MUST include ONLY these fields:
- sceneNumber: Sequential number (1→${requiredScenes})
- references: Array of character/background IDs (e.g., ["char_1", "bg_1"])
- estimatedDuration: 8 (fixed)
- finalVideoPrompt: {
    descriptiveProse: 200-300 words with 8s progression + dialogue timing embedded,
    keywords: 40-60 keywords,
    negativePrompt: {visualQuality, characterConsistency, unwantedBehavior, sceneCoherence, technicalIssues}
  }
- finalAudioPrompt: 2-3 sentences with dialogue timing and mix %

⚠️ DO NOT include: cinematicAnalysis, dialogueContent, cameraAngleMovement, characterAction, lightingColor, audio, or any other intermediate fields

⚠️ REFERENCES FIELD VALIDATION:
- Each scenePrompt must have "references": [...] at root level
- Format: ["char_id_1", "char_id_2", "bg_id_1"] - characters first, then backgrounds
- All IDs must exist in masterConfig.characterProfiles or masterConfig.backgroundProfiles
- Use empty array [] if no characters/backgrounds appear

⚠️ DIALOGUE SYNC VERIFICATION:
All dialogue requirements already specified in "DIALOGUE INTEGRATION (CRITICAL)" section above. Ensure strict compliance.

**⚠️ CHARACTER-DIALOGUE CONSISTENCY RULE:**
- If masterConfig.characterProfiles is EMPTY [], then:
  - NO dialogue allowed in any scene
  - descriptiveProse MUST NOT mention any person, speaker, mouth, face, human character, or people
  - Only describe settings, objects, spaces, camera movements, lighting, atmosphere, and non-human elements
- If masterConfig.characterProfiles has characters, dialogue must reference valid character from characterProfiles

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Return ONLY pure JSON - NO markdown, NO explanation. Ensure JSON is valid.**
