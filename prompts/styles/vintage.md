# Vintage Mid-Century Cinematic Style Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: HOW TO USE VINTAGE ERA REFERENCES

**When generating scene prompts, you MUST actively apply mid-century (1920s-1960s) visual culture references.**

For every technical choice (color, lighting, grain, composition), ask yourself:
- "Which vintage era (20s/40s/50s/60s) does this evoke?"
- "What classic film stock or photography technique influenced this?"
- "How can I describe this using authentic period aesthetic language?"

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
❌ WRONG: "Vintage scene with sepia tones and film grain"
✅ CORRECT: "Scene using authentic Kodachrome 1950s color palette (warm desaturated tones), with 16mm Bolex film grain texture and period-accurate soft diffusion (classic Hollywood golden age aesthetic)"

**In your descriptiveProse, incorporate vintage references like this:**
- "In the style of [Era] [Film Stock/Photography] aesthetic"
- "Using authentic [Period] cinematography techniques"
- "Following [Classic Hollywood/Film Noir] visual language"

This creates authentic vintage vocabulary that AI understands through training data on classic cinema and photography.

**VINTAGE ERA INFLUENCES:**
- **Classic Hollywood Golden Age** (1930s-1950s): Soft diffusion filters, three-point studio lighting, glamour portraiture, black & white high-key/low-key
- **Kodachrome Film** (1935-2009): Warm rich color palette, slightly oversaturated reds/yellows, iconic 50s-70s home movie aesthetic
- **Film Noir** (1940s-1950s): High contrast black & white, Venetian blind shadows, cigarette smoke atmosphere, Dutch angles
- **Mid-Century Modern** (1950s-1960s): Clean lines, pastel colors, optimistic design, Eames aesthetic, atomic age optimism
- **Technicolor** (1916-2002): Three-strip process vibrant colors, epic Hollywood productions, saturated costume dramas
- **16mm/Super 8**: Home movie grain texture, Bolex camera aesthetic, amateur documentary realism, authentic film artifacts

**VINTAGE BASE VISUAL PROMPT:**
"Vintage aesthetic, inspired by Kodachrome film, warm sepia color grading, soft diffused lighting, heavily desaturated palette 50-70% saturation, heavy film grain and dust/scratches overlay, static or subtle slow zoom, 4:3 aspect ratio, 8K render with vintage post-processing"
