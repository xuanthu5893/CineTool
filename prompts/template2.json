“description”: “Tôn Ngộ Không, male mythic monkey-king warrior, height 158cm, compact athletic build with wiry strength, golden-tan fur with subtle darker accents along forearms and jawline, sharp amber eyes with intense highlights, pronounced brow ridge, agile expressive face. Hair: short spiky dark-brown head fur with slightly longer crown tufts. Clothing: traditional mythic battle garb—red-orange sleeveless tunic with gold trim, dark leather bracers, black cloth sash, fitted dark trousers, wrapped shin guards, worn scuffs and dust on knees and hems. Distinctive features: faint scar-like nick on left eyebrow, long prehensile tail kept mostly behind body, confident smirk that switches to focused grimace under pressure. Weapon/prop: Ruyi Jingu Bang (gậy Như Ý), dark iron staff with engraved gold rings, consistent thickness, subtle metallic sheen, never changes length or design in-shot. Voice: Vietnamese, youthful cocky tone shifting to concentrated intensity, but NO spoken dialogue in this project unless explicitly scripted.”

“description”: “Dương Tiễn, male divine warrior, height 182cm, tall athletic build with broad shoulders, calm controlled posture, fair-to-olive skin tone, sharp narrow eyes (steel-gray) with disciplined focus, straight brows, defined jawline, minimal facial emotion. Hair: long black hair tied into a high topknot with a neat braid detail, a few strands moving in wind. Clothing: dark blue-gray armored robe with layered lamellar chest piece, silver accents, structured shoulder guards, long cape/cloak that catches wind, leather belt with metal clasp, dust and grit along lower hem. Distinctive features: centered forehead mark suggesting divine third-eye (kept subtle, not opening unless scripted), composed breathing, precise hand grip. Weapon/prop: Tam Tiêm Đao (three-pointed spear-blade), polished steel with tri-pronged head, dark wrapped haft, consistent shape and reflections. Voice: Vietnamese, low restrained tone, but NO spoken dialogue in this project unless explicitly scripted.”

“description”: “Jagged mountain ridge summit above a rolling sea of clouds, narrow rocky spine with loose gravel and dust, sheer drop-offs on both sides. Strong wind blowing from BACK RIGHT to FRONT LEFT consistently across all scenes, causing capes and cloth to stream toward the left side of frame. Time of day: late afternoon golden hour edging toward dramatic overcast break, warm sun shafts intermittent through cloud gaps. Lighting: dominant 3200K warm key from high back-right at ~30° elevation creating rim light on edges, cooler 6500K ambient fill from cloud reflections, occasional volumetric streaks through mist. Atmosphere: thin mist, dust motes, small pebbles sliding intermittently, distant thunder-like low rumble implied by scale.”

Location is the SAME jagged mountain ridge above a sea of clouds; wind direction is locked BACK RIGHT → FRONT LEFT, continuously pushing cloth and cape toward the left side of frame. SAME character as established - Tôn Ngộ Không (158cm, compact athletic, golden-tan fur, red-orange tunic with gold trim, dark bracers) stands on the LEFT side of frame with Ruyi Jingu Bang planted on rock, body leaning forward as if coiled to spring; SAME character as established - Dương Tiễn (182cm, tall athletic, blue-gray armored robe, long cape) stands on the RIGHT side of frame with Tam Tiêm Đao held upright before him, shoulders relaxed but solid. [0.0s-2.0s] Establish the full ridge geography: both characters locked in a face-off across ~8 meters, eyelines fixed, no one crosses the line; gravel and dust flutter along the ridge crest, clouds churn below. [2.0s-4.0s] Wind gust intensifies, making Wukong’s tunic hem and Yangjian’s cape ripple leftward; Wukong’s mouth forms a cocky half-smirk and eyebrows lift; he rotates his wrist so the staff vibrates subtly in front of his chest producing a small circular whoosh, but his feet remain planted. Yangjian only lowers his chin by a few degrees, tightens his grip on the spear haft, stance unmoving and calm. [4.0s-6.0s] Camera continues the steady dolly-in, keeping Wukong left/Yangjian right; rim light from ~3200K back-right grazes armor edges and staff highlights, while cool cloud fill keeps shadows readable. [6.0s-8.0s] Wukong takes exactly one diagonal step forward (small ADVANCE), left foot forward then weight settles, raising the staff to rest horizontally near his right shoulder preparing a horizontal sweep; Yangjian subtly shifts weight to his back foot and lowers the spear tip by about one hand-span into a ready block without stepping. No dialogue: mouths remain closed except Wukong’s silent expression shift; maintain consistent props, positions, and wind direction through the end frame.”,

“descriptiveProse”: “Direct continuation from Scene 1 end-frame. No new beat starts. Start EXACTLY from previous end-state: [Wukong LEFT in 3/4 facing RIGHT, left foot forward, staff horizontal near right shoulder ready to sweep; Yangjian RIGHT facing LEFT, chin slightly lowered, spear tip lowered one hand-span, distance ~8m, wind BACK RIGHT → FRONT LEFT, cloth streaming left]. Primary action verb: ADVANCE. No other primary action allowed. Distance between the two fighters must monotonically decrease; never increases. No backward step for either character; camera movement must not create a false retreat illusion. Cinematic Medium Wide Shot (MWS) at Eye Level, handheld follow with controlled stability 2.0 ft/sec forward to match the charge, 28mm lens for spatial clarity, aperture f/8 for deep-enough DOF to keep both weapons readable, 24fps with 180° shutter motion blur consistent. [0.0s-2.0s] Wukong explodes forward from the exact stance, pushing off his back foot; his body drops slightly to generate speed, staff still anchored near the right shoulder line. Yangjian remains mostly planted but coils subtly, shoulders squared, spear aligned to intercept; wind continues pushing garments left. [2.0s-4.0s] As the gap collapses toward ~2 meters, Wukong executes one clean horizontal sweep at mid-torso height; the staff arc is crisp and readable, no extra feints. Yangjian rotates hips minimally and brings Tam Tiêm Đao across to block on the sweep line; a heavy metallic impact occurs at center frame with brief sparks, but Yangjian’s hands stay firm and he is not shoved far. [4.0s-6.0s] Without pausing, Wukong changes level: he draws the staff up and delivers a diagonal downward strike aimed toward Yangjian’s left shoulder path; Yangjian answers with a measured half-step back ONLY as described in script? (must match script) — specifically, Yangjian steps back half a step with the right foot to create space while rotating the blade to a diagonal guard, maintaining left-right screen orientation and wind direction. [6.0s-8.0s] The second impact locks the weapons in a crossed bind at the exact center of frame; distance now ~1 meter, both bodies tense—Wukong’s face tightens into focused grimace, Yangjian’s expression stays calm and narrowed. No dialogue; mouths closed throughout; end with the weapons still crossed and pressure held for seamless continuation.”,

“descriptiveProse”: “Direct continuation from Scene 2 end-frame. No new beat starts. Start EXACTLY from previous end-state: [weapons crossed and locked at center frame, Wukong slightly left-of-center pressing down with staff from high-right to center, Yangjian slightly right-of-center bracing upward with spear from low-left to center, distance ~1m, wind BACK RIGHT → FRONT LEFT, cloth streaming left, mouths closed, eyelines locked]. Primary action verb: TURN. No other primary action allowed. Motion constraint: the bind remains engaged until the scripted break; do not reset distance or swap screen sides; no axis flip; any repositioning is a controlled pivot around the bind, not a retreat/advance cheat. Cinematic Medium Shot (MS) at slightly Low Angle to emphasize power, slow arc/orbit 90° over 8 seconds at 2.0 ft/sec, 35mm lens, aperture f/5.6 for balanced DOF, 24fps, subtle film grain, consistent Teal & Orange. [0.0s-2.0s] Wukong strains, shoulders rise and forearms tense as he attempts to press the bind downward; his lead foot grinds on rock creating a visible scrape line, dust puffs drift left with wind. Yangjian yields a fraction—micro-relaxation in elbows—without losing eye contact, giving the impression of “letting force pass.” [2.0s-4.0s] Yangjian executes the scripted tempo break: he rotates his wrist and slides the blade along the staff with a metallic krrrrt, redirecting the bind leftward; the weapon contact point glides rather than separates. Simultaneously, he steps half a step inward, right shoulder closing distance to apply pressure at close range; Wukong’s torso is pulled off-center, his eyes blink once in surprise as his body pivots with the forced angle. [4.0s-6.0s] Wukong recovers exactly as scripted: he snaps the staff upward to disengage the lock and pivots a quarter turn to stay face-to-face, then retreats half a step with his back foot only in this final phase to re-establish guard; staff rises into a diagonal shield across his chest, elbows open slightly. Yangjian does not chase; he stabilizes his stance and lifts the spear tip to hover near Wukong’s neck at a few centimeters without touching, calm dominance. [6.0s-8.0s] Both freeze into a high-tension standoff: Wukong 3/4 but face forward, eyes wide alert, brows drawn down, lips pressed shut; Yangjian poised, chin slightly lifted, eyes cold and focused, spear steady. Wind continues consistent direction, capes stream left, small pebbles roll toward the cliff edge; end-frame must hold this exact poised lock for continuation.”,
